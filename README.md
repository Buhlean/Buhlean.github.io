# [FlowGraph Webdemo](https://buhlean.github.io/)
[Webdemo](https://buhlean.github.io/) for my graph layout program. Written in C, it compiles Mermaid flowcharts.


Made by Alexander Buhl.

Written entirely in C.
This web version exists purely for demoing the program on a desktop browser.
Textbox, compiler and graph layout are entirely handmade.
Platform and graphics abstraction by [raylib](raylib.com)

Syntax follows Mermaid's [Flowchart](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/flowchart) syntax closely.
Graph responds to changes in the text automatically.
Compiler errors guide users to a valid graph.
